# 📊 K-Means Clustering Projects – Loan Approval & Iris Dataset

This repository contains two hands-on machine learning mini-projects using the **K-Means Clustering** algorithm. Both projects demonstrate how unsupervised learning can uncover hidden patterns in datasets — even without labeled data.

---

## 🚀 Projects Included

### 🔹 1. Loan Approval Clustering
**Goal:** Use K-Means to identify clusters of applicants in a loan dataset based on attributes like income, loan amount, and credit history. This clustering can help financial institutions categorize applicants (e.g., low risk vs. high risk) without using labeled outcomes.

**Key Features:**
- Real-world dataset preprocessing (null handling, encoding, scaling)
- Optimal cluster detection using the **Elbow Method**
- K-Means model training and PCA-based visualization
- Insightful cluster interpretation for financial decisions

### 🔹 2. Iris Dataset Clustering
**Goal:** Apply K-Means clustering to the well-known Iris dataset and evaluate how well the algorithm groups the flowers without the species labels.

**Key Features:**
- PCA for 2D visual clustering
- Comparison between actual species and predicted clusters
- Confusion matrix and accuracy calculation to evaluate performance
